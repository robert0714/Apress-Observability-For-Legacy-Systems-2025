# Connector blueprints
Every connector is specified by a connector blueprint. The blueprint defines all the parameters you need to provide when creating a connector.

## OpenSearch-provided connector blueprints
OpenSearch provides connector blueprints for several machine learning (ML) platforms and models. For a list of all connector blueprints provided by OpenSearch, see [Supported connectors](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/remote-models/connectors/#supported-connectors).

### Preprocessing function
The connector.pre_process.default.embedding default preprocessing function parses the neural search request and transforms it into the format that the model expects as input.

The ML Commons Predict API provides parameters in the following format:
```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "input": ["hello", "world"]
  }
}
```
The default preprocessing function sends the input field contents to the model. Thus, the model input format must be a list of strings, for example:
```
["hello", "world"]
```

### Post-processing function
The connector.post_process.default.embedding default post-processing function parses the model response and transforms it into the format that neural search expects as input.

The remote text embedding model output must be a two-dimensional float array, each element of which represents an embedding of a string from the input list. For example, the following two-dimensional array corresponds to the embedding of the list ["hello", "world"]:

```json
[
  [
    -0.048237994,
    -0.07612697,
    ...
  ],
  [
    0.32621247,
    0.02328475,
    ...
  ]
]
```
