# OpenSearch Assistant Toolkit

The OpenSearch Assistant Toolkit helps you create AI-powered assistants for OpenSearch Dashboards. The toolkit includes the following elements:

## Agents and Tools
- https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/agents-tools/index/
- Agents interface with a large language model (LLM) and execute high-level tasks, such as summarization or generating Piped Processing Language (PPL) queries from natural language. The agent’s high-level tasks consist of low-level tasks called tools, which can be reused by multiple agents.

## Configuration Automation
- https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/automating-configurations/index/
- Uses templates to set up infrastructure for artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) applications. For example, you can automate configuring agents to be used for chat or generating PPL queries from natural language.
