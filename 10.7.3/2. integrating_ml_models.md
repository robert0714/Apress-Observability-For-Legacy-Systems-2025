## Choosing a model

To integrate an ML model into your search workflow, choose one of the following options:

- **Local model**: Upload a model to the OpenSearch cluster and use it locally. This option allows you to serve the model in your OpenSearch cluster but may require significant system resources.

  - **Pretrained model provided by OpenSearch**: This option requires minimal setup and avoids the time and effort required to train a custom model.

  For a list of supported models and information about using a pretrained model provided by OpenSearch, see [Pretrained models](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/pretrained-models/).

  - **Custom model**: This option offers customization for your specific use case.

  For information about uploading your model, see [Using ML models within OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/ml-commons-plugin/).

- **Externally hosted model**: This option allows you to connect to a model hosted on a third-party platform. It requires more setup but allows the use of models that are already hosted on a service other than OpenSearch.

  To connect to an externally hosted model, you need to set up a connector:

  - For a walkthrough with detailed steps, see [Connecting to externally hosted models](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/remote-models/index/).

  - For more information about supported connectors, see [Connectors](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/remote-models/connectors/).

  - For information about creating your own connector, see [Connector blueprints](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/remote-models/connector-blueprints/).

In OpenSearch version 2.9 and later, you can integrate local and external models simultaneously within a single cluster.

## Using a model
You can use an ML model in one of the following ways:

- Invoke a model for inference.
- Use a model for search.
