# Reranking search results using the MS MARCO cross-encoder model
A reranking pipeline can rerank search results, providing a relevance score for each document in the search results with respect to the search query. The relevance score is calculated by a cross-encoder model.

## Register a new model group for cross encoder models

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/model_groups/_register
{
    "name": "cross encoder model group",
    "description": "A model group for cross encoder models",
    "access_mode": "public"
}
```

## Register a new model in the previously created model group

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/_register
{
    "name": "huggingface/cross-encoders/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2",
    "version": "1.0.2",
    "model_group_id": "CXu6Y5IBtif6Eh-wdLzN",
    "model_format": "TORCH_SCRIPT"
}
```

## Check the status of the model registration task

```json
GET /_plugins/_ml/tasks/EHu7Y5IBtif6Eh-w0rwN
```

## Deploy the registered model

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/EXu7Y5IBtif6Eh-w07yJ/_deploy
```

## Check the status of the model deployment task

```json
GET /_plugins/_ml/tasks/GHu8Y5IBtif6Eh-w_bw5
```

## Index some sample data into the "my-test-data" index

```json
POST _bulk
{ "index": { "_index": "my-test-data" } }
{ "passage_text" : "Carson City is the capital city of the American state of Nevada." }
{ "index": { "_index": "my-test-data" } }
{ "passage_text" : "The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean. Its capital is Saipan." }
{ "index": { "_index": "my-test-data" } }
{ "passage_text" : "Washington, D.C. (also known as simply Washington or D.C., and officially as the District of Columbia) is the capital of the United States. It is a federal district." }
{ "index": { "_index": "my-test-data" } }
{ "passage_text" : "Capital punishment (the death penalty) has existed in the United States since before the United States was a country. As of 2017, capital punishment is legal in 30 of the 50 states." }
```

## Create a search pipeline for reranking with the deployed Sagemaker cross-encoder model

```json
PUT /_search/pipeline/rerank_pipeline
{
        "description": "Pipeline for reranking with Sagemaker cross-encoder model",
        "response_processors": [
                {
                        "rerank": {
                                "ml_opensearch": {
                                        "model_id": "EXu7Y5IBtif6Eh-w07yJ"
                                },
                                "context": {
                                        "document_fields": ["passage_text"]
                                }
                        }
                }
        ]
}
```

## Perform a search with reranking using the created pipeline

```json
GET my-test-data/_search?search_pipeline=rerank_pipeline
{
    "query": {
        "match_all": {}
    },
    "size": 4,
    "ext": {
        "rerank": {
            "query_context": {
                 "query_text": "What is the capital of the United States?"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Perform a search without reranking

```json
GET my-test-data/_search
{
    "query": {
        "match_all": {}
    },
    "ext": {
        "rerank": {
            "query_context": {
                 "query_text": "What is the capital of the United States?"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
