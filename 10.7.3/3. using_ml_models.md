# Using ML models within OpenSearch
Introduced 2.9
To integrate machine learning (ML) models into your OpenSearch cluster, you can upload and serve them locally. Choose one of the following options:

- [OpenSearch-provided pretrained models](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/pretrained-models/)
- [Supported pretrained models](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/pretrained-models/#supported-pretrained-models)
- Custom models such as PyTorch deep learning models: To learn more, see [Custom models](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/custom-local-models/)

> Running local models on the CentOS 7 operating system is not supported. Moreover, not all local models can run on all hardware and operating systems.


For better performance, you can take advantage of GPU acceleration on your ML node. For more information, see [GPU acceleration](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/gpu-acceleration/)
